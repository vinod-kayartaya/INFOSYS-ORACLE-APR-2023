# Assignment for Day 3

### Assignment 1:

Write a PL/SQL program that prompts the user to enter a number between 1 and 10. The program should use an if-elsif-else statement to print one of the following messages based on the user input:

-   If the number is less than 5, print "Low"
-   If the number is between 5 and 8, print "Medium"
-   If the number is greater than 8, print "High"
-   If the number is not between 1 and 10, print "Invalid input"

### Assignment 2:

Write a PL/SQL program that uses a case-when statement to prompt the user to enter a department ID. The program should display the department name, manager ID, and location ID for the given department ID. If the department ID is not valid, the program should display an error message.

Do not use exception handling mechanism

### Assignment 3:

Write a PL/SQL program that uses a goto label statement to print the first 10 even numbers. The program should use a loop to generate the numbers and a goto statement to skip odd numbers.

### Assignment 4:

Write a PL/SQL program that uses a while loop statement to display the Fibonacci series up to a given number. The program should prompt the user to enter a number and then display the Fibonacci series up to that number. The Fibonacci series starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
